# How to run the bot yourself

First, make a discord application from https://discord.com/developers/applications.

Then, go to the bot section

There, press

Now, create a new python project named after whatever you named your bot. Open it up with your favourite code editor or IDE (I use Pycharm)
Also, you need to import the discord.py library, so, cd into the project folder (if your in pycharm open up the pycharm terminal) then type
`pip install discord`
After thats done installing, your ready to go! Well, mostly. Create a text file called `token.txt`. 
Now, go back to your discord applications page, back to the bot section
There, copy your bot token and paste it into the text file.
Then, you can copy my code and get going! Edit it as you wish.
